    display: inline-flex; /*! Need inline flex instead of flex becuase if it was only flex then the external display is block display which means it takes up entire space horizontally -> colering of non grid parts*/
    flex-direction: row; /*Only affects direct desendents which are the row container divs in the javascript*/
